# MERN Book Tracker

A personal book tracking application built as a learning project while progressing through the MERN stack.

The goal of this project is to incrementally evolve a simple book listing into a full-stack application, documenting architectural decisions and trade-offs along the way.

---

## Project Objectives

- Practice full-stack web development using the MERN stack
- Apply clean project structure and version control from day one
- Build features incrementally instead of prematurely optimizing
- Use this project as a reference point for technical blog posts

---

## Planned Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

Earlier stages may intentionally use simpler approaches (static data, JSON files) before introducing backend and database layers.

---

## Development Approach

This project is developed in phases:

1. Static UI with hardcoded book entries
2. Local JSON-based storage
3. REST API using Express
4. Database integration with MongoDB
5. Authentication and user-specific data (optional)

Each phase builds upon the previous one and is committed separately.
